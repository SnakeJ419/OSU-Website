	<h1>Personal Statements</h1>
	<h2>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement</h2>
	<p>One of the facets of diversity I had never learned about before this class was diversity in learning. In my Engineering 102 class at Oregon State University one of the first things that we talked about before beginning our work in groups was differences in how people best learn new topics. For example some people prefer to be able to tinker with something while others prefer to get a complete understanding of it before they start messing with it. Additionally I believe it is important to acknowledge that I am in a fortunate position as a white male in STEM, however I believe that everyone should be included in the community and in accordance with the College of Engineering's core value of respect as everyone's ideas are equally important. While at Oregon State there are no specific clubs or organizations I plan to join currently however I am going to make it a personal goal of mine to be aware of any hidden bias I may have and check myself in order to make sure everyone is included equally. Oregon State's mission is to produce graduates who are skilled, critical thinkers. I believe that this is something that can be accomplished by anyone and everyone has an equal ability to achieve this. Every community needs unique perspectives and having only the views from one group does not create an inclusive environment in the community or with the products/services that the community produces for others to consume. I hope that I will be able to make this a more inclusive community where everyone feels welcomed.</p>
	<h2>Sustainability Impact Statement</h2>
	<p>While at Oregon State University I want to learn more about sustainable development practices and what can be done by me personally in order to ensure that projects I develop are sustainable. In my first year courses I have learned that there is such a thing as sustainable development but as I move forward in my education I want to learn more about what can be done. While at Oregon State I hope to be able to join a society of computer science students, similar to an engineering society, where they set norms and standards for their members to follow. I then want to influence this society in order to get them to implement sustainability rules for their members to follow. Sustainability is something that affects everyone, the earth does not have an infinite amount of resources. Taking into consideration the impact that your actions have on the world is an important part of decision making. While the intent of releasing bitcoin was never to result in giant mining farms that contribute to the global energy consumption in a significant manner, it is a real result of its release. This is a good example of what can happen if you do not consider all the possible applications of something you release, even if it is just a software application and should serve as a cautionary tale. Through my own personal projects and the projects I am able to influence I would like to prevent something like this from happening. This falls in accordance with Oregon State University's mission to focus on producing sustainable practices in the future.</p>
